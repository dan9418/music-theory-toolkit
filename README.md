# Play What?

*Play What* is soon to be a configurable, extensible music theory visualization tool and React component library. The public Beta is planned for release by September 2019.

## Initial Features

- Configurable presets for Chords, Scales, Modes, and Roman Numerals
    - Built-in support for chordal and melodic inversions
- Easy transposition of any concept to any key and/or octave, calculated efficiently and algorithmically
- Highly configurable components for visualizing these concepts
    - Including a keyboard and fretboard in addition to a simple API for creating custom viewers
- Many additional features are planned for future releases

## Motivation

My primary goals for developing this project are to...

- Learn the ReactJS framework
- Complete a substantial project demonstrating good design and best practices for my portfolio
- Learn complex music theory concepts
- Create a useful, open-source tool that is highly configurable and extensible
