# NOTE

This repo contains early beta code for the the Play What library. Active development has moved to the [play-what](https://github.com/dan9418/play-what) and [play-what-react-viewers](https://github.com/dan9418/play-what-react-viewers) repos.

## Play What?

*Play What* is a music theory toolkit for JavaScript. It provides tools for music theory computations and React components for visualization.

For interactive documentation on this beta version, see the [sample project site](https://dan9418.github.io/play-what-sample/).

## Future of this project

The final version will be published as two packages:

- A pure JS library for music theory utilities
- An official library of React comonents for consuming the core package

I expect to formally release V1 in Spring 2020.
